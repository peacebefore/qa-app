# When Sparknotes and ChatGPT Walk Into a Bar

You get an LLM app that allows you to upload your own documents, and it will answer questions in a conversational format about that document's contents.
Best for when ChatGPT hasn't been trained on the data you need to inquire about, such as:
* Personal documents, such as manuscripts, dissertations, and papers
* Proprietary material (for example, internal company data)
* Data generated after 2021

## Features
* Upload files in .pdf, .docx, .txt formats
* Add your own OpenAI API key
* Modify the chunk size and k parameters
* Retain chat history until document or parameters are modified


## Tools Used for this Project

### Tech Stack
* Python
* Langchain
* OpenAI
* Streamlit
* Vector Embeddings & Vector Store
* Chroma / Pinecone
